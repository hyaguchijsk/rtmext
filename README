(csh,tcsh)
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/path/to/rtmext
setenv RTM_PACKAGE_PATH /usr/local/src/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0/examples:/path/to/private/rtm/comps

* commands

- rtmpack [op] [pack]
-- rtmpack find [pack]
   find package path
-- rtmpack depend [pack]
   solve dependency of package

- rtmmake (--clean) (--nochain) [pack]

* dependency

To solve dependency of your package,
create "manifest.xml" on your package dir.
This file is compatible with ROS,
and must describe depended packages by <depend package="dependency" />.

ex)
<package>
  <description brief="brief">
    description of package
  </description>
  <author>Alan Smithee</author>
  <license>Public Domain</license>
  <depend package="dependency" />
</package>


* rtmcd

To use rtmcd (like roscd), please add following command to your rc file.

(bash,zsh)
function rtmcd () {
    cd `rtmpack find $1`
}

(csh,tcsh)
alias rtmcd 'cd `rtmpack find \!^`'
